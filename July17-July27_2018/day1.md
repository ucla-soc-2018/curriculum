| 30 | Pair Programming  |  | 

With your extra time install Sublime if you don't already have it installed.

Pair programming is an Agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation.   
One person is the **Driver**. They write the code. You are an intelligent keyboard.  
The other person is the **Navigator**. They give hish level commands to the Dreviews each line of code as it is typed in.   
The two programmers switch roles frequently.  
**Hot Potato!** - If someone who is not the Driver tries to get on the keyboard to explain something instead of telling the Driver what to do.

#### Today I am going to be the driver 
#### The Navigator will be the co-pilot
#### You will switch being the driver every 2 minutes

### With your pair  
Using one computer  
+ Open the terminal
+ Create a directory on the Desktop named SOC_UCLA_2018_yourname
+ Change directories into the directory SOC_UCLA_2018_yourname
+ Create a markdown file called `day01.md`
+ Open the file in your Sublime
+ Edit the file `day01.md` in Sublime Add:
    + The day, month. day, year
    + Both of your names
    + Links to all the tutorials you did today
    + Summary of what you learned that day in your words
    + Vocabulary words and their definitions

### Vocabulary
All Vocabulary written as an Object `const vocabulary = { VIM: 'text editor', sublime: 'text editor', Python: 'a programing language', git: 'local vervion control', github: 'version control in the cloud', commandLine: 'the commands you use to talk to your computer', CSS: 'cascading styles sheets'}`

### Pair Programming
During this course you will be paired with a diferent person every day. That person is your pair programming partner.
There will be only one commputer out per pair each day except for today. We need to be sure that everyone has everything they need installed.

At the end of each day the person who does not have their computer out will fire theirs up and `pull` dowm the files from GitHub that you worked on that day.

Make your font bigger so your pair can see it too and so I can see it if you need help.
