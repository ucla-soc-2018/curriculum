### Overview of what we will learn for whole session
+ HTML
+ CSS
+ JavaScript
+ Version control in Git and GitHub
+ VIM (text editor)
+ Sublime  (text editor)
+ Markdown
+ Python
+ Data Types
+ Algorithms
+ Contributing to a project
+ Pair programming
+ Agile workflow
+ Project management
+ Communication
+ Possibly: Flask (Python framework)

The class itself will be Agile which means it may shift based on the skills and pace of the students.

We are going to keep working on the same skills over the course of this session so by the time you return home you can teach these skills to your brother, sister, friends and your parents. **That is your true final exam, Teach someone.**

If you already have everything installed you will help the people who do not.

A very important part of being a programmer is being able to communicate. Often, as a profession developer you will have to explain what you are doing to people who dom't know anything about programming. The better you can do this the more valuable you are.

## Projects
